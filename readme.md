JTixTax
=======
This is a Simple Clone of the Game TixTax, written in Java. 
At the moment it can only be played in the console, against
either a real opponent or and "AI" that chooses a random 
move. To change the Player type, simply replace 
`new RandomAI(...)` with `new CommandLinePlayer(...)` or vice versa.
