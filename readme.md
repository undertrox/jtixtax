JTixTax
=======
This is a Simple Clone of the Game TixTax, written in Java. 
At the moment it can only be played in the console, against
either a real opponent or and "AI" that chooses a random 
move. To change the Player type, simply replace 
`new RandomAI(...)` with `new ConsolePlayer(...)`. The default
configuration is two `RandomAI`s battling each other. the
winner is printed into the Console.
